Mainly an intellectual exercise (but hey, could be useful at some point). Not happy with how everything is laid out, but it'll do for now.

Stuff to add:

* more restaurant info (address, phone, etc)
* "new" and "special price" indicators
* sub-item options (e.g.: "add chicken")
* photos

Other misc. notes:

* Styles are mobile first and probably an unsupportable mishmash of ems and percentages.
* The responsive nav is very rudimentary.
* I'm not really a fan of the way the titles wrap around the item number.
* At smallest size the price gets squished into the right margin.
* Some tags are left un-closed in order to avoid whitespace messing with inline-block elements.
